## Physarum

- large, single-celled amoeboid organism
- forage for patchily distributed food sources

- initially explores with a relatively contiguous foraging margin - maximize the area searched
- linking the discovered food sources through 
  - direct connections, or
  - additional intermediate junctions (reduce the overall length of the connecting network)
  - formation of occasional cross-links (improve overall transport efficiency and resilience)
- Growing is influence by 
  - characteristics of the substrate
  - physical barriers (constraint)
  - light regime
- find the shortest path through 
  - a maze
  - connect different arrays of food sources in an efficient manner with 
    - low total length (TL)
    - short average minimum distance (MD) between pairs of food sources (FSs)
    - high degree of fault tolerance (FT) to accidental disconnection


- Once these have been located, the many branches it has sent out die back, 
- leaving only the most efficient route between food source nodes.

- slime has mapped the optimum transport networks of numerous cities, as well as the Silk Road and a full global trade route.


Simulation Methodology:


## cellular automata


## agent-based models

1. schelling segregation
2. sugar scape
